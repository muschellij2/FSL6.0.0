# V1 2005_07_28 Johannes Klein/Mark Jenkinson, FMRIB Centre
# V2 2007_07_05 KLM: added input for TE time (seems to be 2.46 now??)
# V2 2007_07_06 KLM: added detection of magnitude image dimensions
# V4 2007_09_15 KLM: changed to work with new fsltools
# V5 2008_03_19 MJ: subsantially modified to do sanity checking and work with VARIAN - first supported version in FMRIB
