    University harmless from and against any and all claims, damages and
    liabilities asserted by third parties (including claims for
    negligence) which arise directly or indirectly from the use of the
    Software or the sale of any products based on the Software.
    
    No part of the Software may be reproduced, modified, transmitted or
    transferred in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical,
    without the express permission of the University. The permission of
    the University is not required if the said reproduction, modification,

    of the source code or the Software into a product for sale or license
    by or on behalf of Licensee to third parties or (2) use of the
    Software or any derivative of it for research with the final aim of
    developing software products for sale or license to a third party or
    (3) use of the Software or any derivative of it for research with the
    final aim of developing non-software products for sale or license to a
    third party, or (4) use of the Software to provide any service to an
    external organisation for which payment is received. If you are
    interested in using the Software commercially, please contact Oxford
