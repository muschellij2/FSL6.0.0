<p>The libxml++ API takes, and gives, strings in the UTF-8 Unicode encoding, which can support all known languages and locales. This choice was made because, of the encodings that have this capability, UTF-8 is the most commonly accepted choice. UTF-8 is a multi-byte encoding, meaning that some characters use more than 1 byte. But for compatibility, old-fashioned 7-bit ASCII strings are unchanged when encoded as UTF-8, and UTF-8 strings do not contain null bytes which would cause old code to misjudge the number of bytes. For these reasons, you can store a UTF-8 string in a std::string object. However, the std::string API will operate on that string in terms of bytes, instead of characters.</p>
<p>Because Standard C++ has no string class that can fully handle UTF-8, libxml++ uses the Glib::ustring class from the glibmm library. Glib::ustring has almost exactly the same API as std::string, but methods such as length() and operator[] deal with whole UTF-8 characters rather than raw bytes.</p>
<p>There are implicit conversions between std::string and Glib::ustring, so you can use std::string wherever you see a Glib::ustring in the API, if you really don't care about any locale other than English. However, that is unlikely in today's connected world.</p>
<p>glibmm also provides useful API to convert between encodings and locales.</p>
