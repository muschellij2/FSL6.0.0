Building libxml++ with Visual Studio .NET 2008

* You will need Visual Studio .NET 2008 (MSVC 9.0).  See the MSVC_Net2005/ folder if you want to build libxml++ using Visual Studio .NET 2005 (MSVC 8.0) or the MSVC_Net2010/ folder if you want to build libxml++ using Visual Studio 2010 (MSVC 10.0). Earlier versions of the compiler, including 6.0, 7.0 and 7.1 will not work.  
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/
* Build libsigc++ 2.0.6 and glibmm from source
* Add GTK+, libsigc++ and glibmm to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio. 
* Load the MSVC_Net2008/libxml++.sln solution. 
* Build the entire solution.  Run the tests.
