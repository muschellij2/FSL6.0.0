/* GDCHART 0.11.xdev  28 Feb 2002 */
/* Copyright Bruce Verderaime 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 */

This release no longer includes gd1.3.  It relies on the latest version
of libgd ( v1.8.4 or higher available: www.boutell.com/gd/ ). 
gd-1.8.4 in turn relies on libpng and zlib (and optionally libjpeg, and libfreetype).

There's no configure script.  gd-1.8.4+ must be compiled and installed, before
gdchart0.11.0 can be built.
makefile will likely need to be edited to change paths to libgd.
The makefile defaults to include jpeg and freetype, and assumes they are installed,
and libgd was built with those options as well.

The new option GDC_image_type has been added over v0.951dev.
Allowable types: GDC_GIF, GDC_PNG, GDC_JPEG, GDC_WBMP.

Though dev, it is a stable release.
