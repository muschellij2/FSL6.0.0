<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of FSL6.0.0 is to upload the FSL 6.0.0 source code to GitHub
for easier searching. The source code can be downloaded from
<https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads_registration>. All data images
have been removed from this repo, so this is not a full installation.
Please only use for navigating the source code and be sure to read the
FSL licenses on use.
