This automatically removes all non-brain tissue from the image. It can optionally output the binary brain mask that was derived during this process, and output an estimate of the external surface of the skull, for use as a scaling constraint in later registration. <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">pairreg</tt>, a script supplied with <a href="./FLIRT.html">FLIRT</a> - FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool. This script calls FLIRT with a special optimisation schedule, to register two brain images whilst at the same time using two skull images to hold the scaling constant (in case the brain has shrunk over time, or the scanner calibration has changed). The script first calls FLIRT to register the brains as fully as possible. This registration is then applied to the skull images, but only the scaling and skew are allowed to change. This is then applied to the brain images, and a final pass optimally rotates and translates the brains to get the best final registration. <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><p class="line867"><a href="./FAST.html">fast</a> - FMRIB's Automated Segmentation Tool. This program automatically segments a brain-only image into different tissue types (normally background, grey matter, white matter, CSF and other). It also corrects for bias field. It is used in various ways in the SIENA scripts. Note that both <tt class="backtick">siena</tt> and <tt class="backtick">sienax</tt> allow you to choose between segmentation of grey matter and white matter as separate classes or a single class. It is important to choose the right option here, depending on whether there is or is not reasonable grey-white contrast in the image. <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><br>

If you need to call BET with a different threshold than the default of 0.5, use <tt class="backtick">-f&nbsp;&lt;threshold&gt;</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line862">Run <tt class="backtick">siena_flirt</tt>, a separate script, to register the two brain images. This first calls the FLIRT-based registration script <tt class="backtick">pairreg</tt> (which uses the brain and skull images to carry out constrained registration). It then deconstructs the final transform into two half-way transforms which take the two brain images into a space halfway between the two, so that they both suffer the same amount of interpolation-related blurring. Finally the script produces a multi-slice gif picture showing the registration quality, with one transformed image as the background and edges from the other transformed image superimposed in red. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><p class="line862">The final step is to carry out change analysis on the registered brain images. This is done using the program <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt>. (In order to improve slightly the accuracy of the <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt> program, a self-calibration script <tt class="backtick">siena_cal</tt>, described later, is run before this.) <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt> carries out the following steps: <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><ul><li>Transforms original whole head images and brain masks for each time point into the space halfway between them, using the two halfway transforms previously generated. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span></li><li>Combines the two aligned masks using logical OR (if either is 1 then the output is 1). <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span></li><li>The combined mask is used to mask the two aligned head images, resulting in aligned brain images. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span></li><li><p class="line862">The change between the two aligned brain images is now estimated, using the following method (note that options given to the <tt class="backtick">siena</tt> script are passed on to <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt>): Apply tissue segmentation to the first brain image. At all points which are reported as boundaries between brain and non-brain (including internal brain-CSF boundaries), compute the distance that the brain surface has moved between the two time points. This motion of the brain edge (perpendicular to the local edge) is calulated on the basis of sub-voxel correlation (matching) of two 1D vectors; these are taken from the 3D images, a fixed distance either side of the surface point, and perpendicular to it, and are differentiated before correlation, allowing some variation in the two original images. Compute mean perpendicular surface motion and convert to PBVC. <span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span></li><li><p class="line862">To make this conversion between mean perpendicular edge motion and PBVC, it is necessary to assume a certain relationship between real brain surface area, number of estimated edge points and real brain volume. This number can be estimated for general images, but will vary according to slice thickness, image sequence type, etc, causing small scaling errors in the final PBVC. In order to correct for this, self-calibration is applied, in which <tt class="backtick">siena</tt> calls <tt class="backtick">siena_cal</tt>. This script runs <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt> on one of the input images relative to a scaled version of itself, with the scaling pre-determined (and therefore known). Thus the final PBVC is known in advance and the estimated value can be compared with this to get a correction factor for the current image. This is done for both input images and the average taken, to give a correction factor to be fed into <tt class="backtick">siena_diff</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">The files created in the SIENA output directory are: <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><ul><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">report.siena</tt> the SIENA log, including the final PBVC estimate. <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">report.html</tt> a webpage report including images showing various stages of the analysis, the final result and a description of the SIENA method. <span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">A_halfwayto_B_render</tt> a colour-rendered image of edge motion superimposed on the halfway A image.

Thus, as with two-time-point atrophy, the brain is registered (this time to the standard brain), again using the skull as the scaling constraint. Thus brain tissue volume (estimated below) will be relative to a &quot;normalised&quot; skull size. (Ignore the &quot;WARNING: had difficulty finding robust limits in histogram&quot; message; this appears because FLIRT isn't too happy with the unusual histograms of skull images, but is nothing to worry about in this context.) Note that all later steps are in fact carried out on the original (but stripped) input image, not the registered input image; this is so that the original image does not need to be resampled (which introduces blurring). Instead, to make use of the normalisation described above, the brain volume (estimated by the segmentation step described below) is scaled by a scaling factor derived from the normalising transform, before being reported as the final normalised brain volume. <span class="anchor" id="line-122"></span></li><li>A standard brain image mask, (derived from the MNI152 and slightly dilated) is transformed into the original image space (by inverting the normalising transform found above) and applied to the brain image.
