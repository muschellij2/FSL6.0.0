<span class="anchor" id="line-5"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">Generally speaking, yes you should. You should include all the task EVs which <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span>were in your GLM model, even those which are not involved in generating your <span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span>PPI regressor. This will make the model overall a better description of the <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span>data. However, in the literature you find papers which do this, and papers <span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span>which don’t. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="I_want_to_show_that_my_ROI_interacts_with_some_areas_more_in_condition_A_than_condition_B_.28rather_than_just_showing_interaction_is_greater_in_condition_A_than_baseline.29._How_do_I_do_that.3F">I want to show that my ROI interacts with some areas more in condition A than condition B (rather than just showing interaction is greater in condition A than baseline). How do I do that?</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line874">Since you can only generate an interaction between two regressors, you will <span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span>need to make a task regressor (for your PSY EV) which embodies the contrast <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span>A-B. In other words, make a 3-column format regressor which has all the task <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span>blocks of A and B in it, but the weight (3rd column value) of A is 1 and the <span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span>weight of B is -1. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line874">Then your regressors will be A-B, your ROI timecourse, and the interaction <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span>between ROI timecourse and A-B (as above). <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867"><img alt="making a 1,-1 task regressor" class="attachment" src="attachments/PPIFAQ/Picture_7.png" title="making a 1,-1 task regressor" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line874">In this case you should not include A and B as well, or your design will be <span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span>rank deficient. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line874">However, if you are using A-B, you SHOULD also include a regressor for A+B <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span>(make it in 3-column format as above with all A's and B's in a single file, <span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span>but all the A's and B's will have a weight of +1). The reason for doing this <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span>is that by including A-B, you can model all the differences between A and B - <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span>but not the shared variance. Including A+B mops up this shared variance. In <span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span>terms of the overall model fit, {A-B and A+B} should give the same overall fit <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span>as {A and B} did in your original model. Mathematically, we would say {A+B and <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span>A-B} span the same vector space as {A and B}. <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">This approach should work even if you want to combine more EVs (eg <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span>A-(B+C)). Just set the weight of all the ‘minus’ conditions (B and C here) to <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span>-1, and the ‘plus’ conditions (A here) to 1 - and be sure to click the <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span>zero-centre EV button when you are making your PPI regressor. <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line867">
<h3 id="Can_I_include_more_than_one_ROI.2F_PPI_in_my_model.3F">Can I include more than one ROI/ PPI in my model?</h3>
<span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line874">Not a good idea in general. You are still running a GLM analysis which, as <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span>always, rests on the assumption that your regressors are orthogonal (or close <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span>to it). Your timecourses are likely not orthogonal, especially if you picked <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span>them from the same GLM output. This will screw up your analysis. Instead, run <span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span>separate analyses for each ROI. You can then compare between them with a <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span>higher-level Feat analysis. <span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
