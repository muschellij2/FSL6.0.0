It would calculate a relative perfusion map using an inversion of the standard ASL kinetic model with the default parameters specified in <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1-1"></span><div class="highlight console"><div class="codearea" dir="ltr" lang="en"><pre dir="ltr" id="CA-8c252aa1f348cc666643ead891655de857aabbf8" lang="en"><span class="line"><span class="anchor" id="line-1-2"></span><span class="LineNumber">oxford_asl -i &lt;asl_data&gt; -o &lt;output_dir_name&gt; -s &lt;struct_image&gt; -t &lt;struct2std_trans.mat&gt; -c &lt;M0_calib_image&gt; --tr=5 --tis=0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1.0,1.2,1.4,1.6,2.0,2.2</span></span>

The resulting tissue perfusion map would registered into standard space by way of the structural image <tt class="backtick">&lt;struct_image&gt;</tt> and structural to standard transformation matrix <tt class="backtick">&lt;struct2std_trans.mat&gt;</tt>. Finally a calibrated perfusion map (in ml/100g/min) would be produced using the calibration image <tt class="backtick">&lt;M0_calib&gt;</tt> (a proton density weighted image with TR of 5 s) using CSF as a reference to calculate the equilibrium magnetisation of blood within an automatically generated CSF mask (from a segmentation of the structural image). Results are provided both in the native space of the original perfusion image, as well as in standard space (in case the registration needs to be revisited later). <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line862">When a structural image is supplied <tt class="backtick">Oxford_asl</tt> will try to register the resulting CBF image to the structural image. <strong>It is very important to inspect whether the registration has worked by examining the final result</strong>. In practice the current default registration is only robust for some forms of ASL data. There are a couple of options that can improve the robustness of registration (see below). Advanced custom registration can be done using the <tt class="backtick">native_space</tt> results directly and either <tt class="backtick">asl_reg</tt> or <tt class="backtick">flirt</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Changes_from_FSL_5.0.6_onward">Changes from FSL 5.0.6 onward</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">Oxford_asl</tt> was modified in FSL 5.0.6 to make it more consistent with the ASL consensus paper. Thus T1 values differ from the earlier releases and the inversion efficiency is now included by default (this can be 'turned off' by setting <tt class="backtick">--alpha=1</tt>) - the new defaults for these can be found by typing <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> on the command line and consulting the usage information. <tt class="backtick">Oxford_asl</tt> now also expects all structural images to have already been brain extracted (in the past <tt class="backtick">bet</tt> was run internally). This now leaves it up to the user to choose their preferred <tt class="backtick">bet</tt> options and get the brain extraction they wish without any further modification by <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="Output">Output</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line862">The outputs from <tt class="backtick">Oxford_ASL</tt> are a resting state perfusion image called <tt class="backtick">perfusion.nii.gz</tt>, which provides blood flow in relative (scanner) units, and, fi data at multiple inflow-times is supplied, an arrival time image called <tt class="backtick">arrival.nii.gz</tt>. If calibration has been requested then a further image <tt class="backtick">perfusion_calib.nii.gz</tt> is also produced, which is a flow map in absolute units (ml/100g/min). <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line862">If calibration was performed using a CSF reference then a text file called <tt class="backtick">M0b.txt</tt> will be created that saves the estimated M0 value from arterial blood. If a CSF mask was not supplied then the automatically generated one (from segmentation of the structural image) will also be saved in the output directory as <tt class="backtick">csf_mask.nii.gz</tt>. It is good practice to examine this to ensure that any voxels in the mask are well within the CSF of the low resolution ASL images. <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line862">A subdirectory is always created called <tt class="backtick">native_space</tt> in which perfusion and arrival time images in the native resolution of the ASL data are saved. These are useful if you find the registration to be unsatisfactory, allowing a new registration to be performed without having to repeat the main analysis. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line867">

<h2 id="acquisition_specific">acquisition specific</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line874">At the very least you need to specify the inflow-time(s) (inversion times for pASL, bolus duration plus post-labelling delay of pcASL) for the data acquisition along with the labelling strategy (pASL or pcASL) and bolus duration (label duration). <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><ul><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--tis=&lt;TI1,TI2,TI3...&gt;</tt>         This option specifies the list of inflow-times used in the data acquisition, a comma separated list of values should be provided (that matches the order in the data). If the data contains multiple repeats of the same TI or set of TIs then it is only necessary to list the unique TIs. For multi-TI data <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> will take the mean of the values for each TI before model-fitting, if you dont want it to do this then use the <tt class="backtick">--fulldata</tt> option. <span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--casl</tt>       Data was acquired using cASL or pcASL labelling, default is pASL labelling. <span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--bolus=&lt;bolus_duration&gt;</tt>     use this to specify the duration of the ASL labelling bolus used in the sequence (in seconds), for pcASL this is the label duration.

For (mutli-TI) pASL the value is not determined <em>a priori</em> by the sequence, but the value specified by this option is used as the initial guess to estimate it from the data. <span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--bat=&lt;BAT_value&gt;</tt>    An approximate bolus arrival time value, defaults to 0.7 s for pASL and 1.3 s for pcASL (based on experience). For single-TI data this value should make only a small difference to the quantification (and a value of 0 may be used if preferred and to be consistent with the ASL consensus paper). For multi-TI data this value is only used as prior information on the typical BAT data expected in the data, the actual value will be estimated from the data. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--t1=&lt;T1_value&gt;</tt>      The T1 value of tissue, 1.3 s by default (assuming acquisition at 3T). <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--t1b=&lt;T1b_value&gt;</tt>    The T1 value of arterial blood, 1.65 s by default (assuming acquisition at 3T). <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--slicedt=&lt;timing_difference_value&gt;</tt>  For multi-slice acquisitions where superior slices are acquired later than those below., this provides the increase in time after labeling for a superior slice relative to the one directly below.

<span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line874">The structural image is used as a reference for registration, to generate a CSF mask for absolute quantification (if called for) and to provide partial volume estimates for correction of perfusion for partial volume effects (if requested).

The advantage of this option is that BASIL is able to make a better estimate of the noise in the data and thus may be more accurate (especially at estimating variances). The disadvantage is slower computation times. This option is recommended if your data has a few inflow-times (&lt;5) repeated many times (otherwise BASIL is working with only a small number of data points after averaging at each inflow time). <span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--noiseprior</tt>  BASIL uses the data to estimate the noise level starting from a non-informative initial guess.

Default values are used by asl_calib based on a 3T field strength (these can be checked by calling <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> at the command line). <span class="anchor" id="line-110"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--te</tt> (optional) <tt class="backtick">[Echo&nbsp;time&nbsp;for&nbsp;readout&nbsp;in&nbsp;ms]</tt>      Set the echo time for the reaodut so that T2(*) effects are taken into account in the calibration. If this is not supplied then TE = 0 ms is assumed, i.e. T2(*) effects are negligible. Default values are assumed by <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> for T2(*) values, you might wish to treat these with caution as these are estimates based on the literature. <span class="anchor" id="line-111"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--t2star</tt> (optional)  Tells oxford_asl to correct for T2* rather than T2 effects. This simply tells asl_calib to use the default values for T2* in place of T2 in the calculations. <span class="anchor" id="line-112"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--t2csf</tt> (optional) <tt class="backtick">[T2&nbsp;value&nbsp;for&nbsp;CSF]</tt>      Supply a value for the T2 of CSF to be used in the calibration process, only relevant if you supply the TE value. Default values are used by <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> based on a 3T field strength (these can be checked by calling <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> at the command line). <span class="anchor" id="line-113"></span></li><li><p class="line891"><tt class="backtick">--t2bl</tt> (optional) <tt class="backtick">[T2&nbsp;value&nbsp;for&nbsp;blood]</tt>     Supply a value for the T2 of blood to be used in the calibration process, only relevant if you supply the TE value. Default values are used by <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> based on a 3T field strength (these can be checked by calling <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> at the command line). <span class="anchor" id="line-114"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-116"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-117"></span><a href="./CategoryBASIL.html">CategoryBASIL</a> <span class="anchor" id="line-118"></span><span class="anchor" id="bottom"></span></div>
