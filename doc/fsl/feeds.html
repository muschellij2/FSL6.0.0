<H2>FSL EVALUATION AND EXAMPLE DATA SUITE</H2>

There is an evaluation and example data package available to accompany
FSL. This package performs two functions - it tests whether your FSL
tools are working properly, and provides example data to try running
FSL on. The <b>evaluation</b> of FSL is carried out by a single script
which normally takes between 1 and 2 hours to run (depending on your
computer), testing most of the major tools in FSL on example data. It
compares the output of each test with precomputed output data supplied
with the package, and reports significant differences as failures. The
<b>example data</b> includes both example input and example output
data. There is a detailed description below of how to analyse the
input data - this is a quick way of starting to use FSL. For more
details, see <a
