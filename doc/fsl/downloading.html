<H2>DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING</H2>
 
<p><br><H3>Downloading</H3>

<P> FSL is available precompiled for the Linux and Mac OS X operating
systems. Windows is supported via a Linux Virtual Machine. The sources are also
available if you want to compile it yourself.

<P> <B><A HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/"

<li><a href="macosx.html">Mac OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="linux.html">Linux</a></li>
<li><a href="windows.html">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="compiling.html">You are compiling the source distribution
instead of taking a binary distribution</a></li>
</ul>

<br><br><H3>Running</H3>

<P>Make sure the following is present somewhere in your shell setup file (.bashrc,
.profile, .cshrc etc., depending on what shell you use), changing
"/usr/local/fsl" to wherever you have installed FSL:

<p><b>bash / sh / ksh</b><code><br>
FSLDIR=/usr/local/fsl<br>
. ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh<br>
PATH=${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}<br>
export FSLDIR PATH</code>

<p><b>tcsh / csh</b><code><br>
setenv FSLDIR /usr/local/fsl<br>
source ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh<br>
setenv PATH ${FSLDIR}/bin:${PATH}</code>

<P>To run the FSL tools from the command line, you can find the
tools in $FSLDIR/bin. In general command-line programs are lower case
(e.g. '<b>bet</b>'). In general the GUI version is capitalised
(e.g. '<b>Bet</b>'), except on Mac, where '_gui' is appended
because those file systems can't tell the difference between upper and
lower case (e.g. '<b>Bet_gui</b>').

<p>To bring up a simple GUI which is just a menu of the main
individual FSL GUI tools, just type <b>fsl</b>.


<br><br><a name="custom"></a><br><br><H3>Customising (for different output datatypes, etc.) </H3>

<p>There are several environment variables which FSL uses to determine
certain user preferences, such as the output file format (NIFTI_GZ, NIFTI_PAIR, etc). 
The defaults for these are set when you source the
setup file as shown above (i.e., ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh). If you wish to change these defaults
then you need to:<pre>
cd
mkdir .fslconf
cd .fslconf</pre>

and in this directory create a file called fsl.sh or fsl.csh,
depending on the shell that you use, setting any or all of the
variables that appear in the central ${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh or
${FSLDIR}/etc/fslconf/fsl.csh files. 
<p>
<b>
DO NOT copy the central files into <kbd>~/.fslconf/</kbd> as it
will cause a loop that will stop your login from working.
</b>
<p>
It is recommended that the files <kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.sh</kbd> or
<kbd>~/.fslconf/fsl.csh</kbd> only include a few variable definitions
and nothing more.  Note that whoever installs FSL can also edit the
central files in <kbd>$FSLDIR/etc/fslconf</kbd> to change the
preferences for all users.


<br><br><a name="sge"></a><br><br><H3>Setting up FSL to use a
  SunGridEngine (or similar) computing cluster</H3>

Several of the more compute-intensive tools can now take advantage of
cluster computing, via SunGridEngine (SGE):

<UL>

<LI>FEAT will run multiple first-level analyses in parallel if they are setup
  all together in one GUI setup. At second level, if full FLAME
  (stages 1+2) is selected then all the slices are processed in
  parallel.

<LI>MELODIC will run multiple single-session analyses (or
  single-session preprocessing if a multi-session/subject analysis is
  being done) in parallel if they are setup all together in one GUI
  setup.

<LI>TBSS will run all registrations in parallel.

<LI>BEDPOST (FDT) low-level diffusion processing will run all slices
  in parallel. 

<LI>FSL-VBM will run all registrations in parallel, both at the
  template-creation stage and at the final registrations stage.

<LI>POSSUM will process all slices in parallel.

</UL>

All the above tools interact with a compute cluster via a single
central script <b>fsl_sub</b>; if no cluster is available then this
script silently runs all the requested jobs in series.

To customise FSL for your local compute cluster and clustering
software, simply edit ${FSLDIR}/bin/fsl_sub - hopefully the comments
in this file are sufficient to make this fairly painless, particularly
for labs using SGE. For other clustering software than SGE, note that
fsl_sub makes use of an SGE feature allowing the submission of a text
file containing a list of commands (one per line) to be run in
parallel.
