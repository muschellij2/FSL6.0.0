<H2>WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE</H2>

<hr><P><b>Release 4.1, June 2008</b><br>
Minor release revision history <a href="#revisions">here</a>.<UL>

<LI><a href="../fnirt/index.html" target="_top">FNIRT</a> - FMRIB's
  Nonlinear Image Registration Tool. The first release of an accurate
  and yet fast nonlinear registration tool. This replaces IRTK, and is
  based on a similar warp field representation, but a) includes
  relative bias field modelling for improved accuracy and b) is very
  fast because of explicit computation of the cost function
  Hessian. FEAT, MELODIC, TBSS and FSL-VBM have all been updated to
  use FNIRT.

<LI><a href="../feat5/index.html">FEAT</a> v5.98. Various
       improvements, including FNIRT nonlinear registration, outlier
       modelling in higher-level analysis and higher-level voxelwise
       covariates (e.g., for structural confound modelling). A new
       script <code>feat_gm_prepare</code> makes it easy to process
       structural data for use as a higher-level voxelwise confound
       covariate.

<LI><a href="../randomise/index.html">randomise</a> v2.1. Various
  improvements, including improved handling of confounds, TFCE
  optimisation for TBSS and parallelisation over multiple computers.

<LI><a href="../fast4/index.html">FAST</a> v4.1 is now the default
  tissue-type segmentation program, and FAST v3 has been removed from
  FSL. Hence all programs
  including <a href="../siena/index.html">SIENA/SIENAX</a> now use
  FAST v4.

<LI><a href="../first/index.html">FIRST</a> subcortical segmentation
is now considerably faster, has improved boundary correction and now
includes a cerebellum model.

<LI>The <i>outputting</i> of ANALYZE files is no longer supported as the
  format is now strongly discouraged.



</ul>

<hr><P><b>Release 4.0, August 2007</b><br><ul>

<LI><a href="../melodic/index.html" target="_top">MELODIC</a> v3.0 -
  now contains multi-subject ICA, including Tensor-ICA
  spaceXtimeXsubjects decomposition.

<LI><a href="../first/index.html" target="_top">FIRST</a> - FMRIB's
  Integrated Registration and Segmentation Tool. The first release of
  a new tool which uses mesh models trained with a large amount of
  rich hand-segmented training data to segment subcortical brain
  structures.

<LI><a href="../fdt/index.html" target="_top">FDT</a> - FMRIB's
  Diffusion Toolbox now has Bayesian crossing-fibre modelling with
  automatic estimation of the number of crossing fibres.

<LI><a href="../possum/index.html" target="_top">POSSUM</a> -
  Physics-Oriented Simulated Scanner for Understanding MRI. An FMRI
  data simulator that produces realistic simulated images and FMRI
  time series given a gradient echo pulse sequence, a segmented object
  with known tissue parameters, and a motion sequence.

<LI><a href="../data/atlas-descriptions.html" target="_top">Standard Space
    Atlases</a> - several complementary brain atlases, integrated into
    FSLView and Featquery, allowing viewing of structural and
    cytoarchitectonic standard space labels and probability maps for
    cortical and subcortical structures and white matter tracts.

<LI><a href="../fslview/index.html" target="_top">FSLView</a> - in
  addition to the new atlases, new functionality includes 3D surface
  rendering and crossing-fibre diffusion direction viewing.

<LI><a href="../fslvbm/index.html">FSL-VBM</a> - an implementation of
  VBM-style analysis of grey matter density using FSL tools.

<LI><a href="../tbss/index.html" target="_top">TBSS</a> v1.1 -
improved registration efficiency in conjunction with the release of a
new standard space FA template, the <a href="../data/FMRIB58_FA.html"
target="_top">FMRIB58_FA</a>. Also it is now possible to
back-transform skeleton-space voxels into subjects' native DTI space,
for example to allow the automated seeding of tractography in FDT.

<LI><a href="../fabber/index.html">FABBER</a> - Fast ASL & BOLD
Bayesian Estimation Routine.  Efficient nonlinear modelling and
estimation of BOLD and CBF from dual-echo ASL data, using Variational
Bayes.

<LI>The mechanism for running FSL under windows has changed. Instead
  of using Cygwin we now use VMware Player (freely available) with a
  Linux virtual machine inside it.

<LI>FAST4 - a beta release of a new version of the FAST generic
  segmentation tool.

<LI><a href="../randomise/index.html">Randomise</a> v2.0 permutation
  testing - new features including: automatically correctly dealing
  with general contrasts and confounds, f-tests, TFCE (threshold-free
  cluster enhancement, a new method for cluster-based statistics).

<LI>Several of the more compute-intensive tools can now take advantage
of cluster computing, via <a href="downloading.html#sge">SunGridEngine
(SGE)</a>. For example, FEAT, MELODIC, TBSS, BEDPOST (FDT), POSSUM and
FSL-VBM can automatically parallelise their processing to reduce total
analysis time.

<LI>New standard space templates. We have moved to a better version of
the MNI152 standard-space image. This is based on the same dataset
that was used to create the avg152T1 but using nonlinear registration
instead of linear (many thanks to Andrew Janke and MNI for
this). MNI152_T1_2mm is the new default standard image, also available
at 1mm and 0.5mm. MNI152lin_T1_2mm is what we are calling the old
standard image, based on linear registration.

<LI><a href="../feat5/index.html">FEAT</a> - v5.90, various
  miscellaneous updates including partial integration of the new
  atlases into Featquery.

<LI><a href="../bet2/index.html">BET</a> - old C code now removed and
  replaced with equivalent "bet2" C++ program; new wrapper script
  "bet" which adds various functionality such as improved eye and neck
  removal.

<LI><a href="../avwutils/index.html">FSLUTILS</a>: all C++ utils
  ending with "++" now have had the "++" stripped off, as all the old
  C code with a similar name has been removed. Also, all programs
  starting with "avw" are now renamed to start with "fsl",
  e.g. "fslmaths". A script "avw2fsl" has been provided to help
  convert users' shell and TCL scripts to use the new command names.

<LI>NIFTI i/o updated to use the sourceforge library.

<LI>Warp field inversion is now possible with "invwarp".

<LI>Removed FSL dependency on Tix, Gnuplot and ImageMagick; any
  generic recent TCL/TK can now be used for the scripts and GUIs.

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 3.3, April 2006</b>

<UL>

<LI>TBSS - first
release of Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, for voxel-based
multi-subject statistics on diffusion (e.g. FA) data. TBSS uses the
IRTK nonlinear registration software, binaries of which are bundled
with this release of FSL.

<LI>FEAT v5.6 new features:
  <UL>
    <LI>Perfusion FMRI modelling/subtraction
    <LI>Contrast estimability (meanginful rank deficiency and
    efficiency estimation)
    <LI>FUGUE EPI unwarping now an option in pre-stats, to be applied
    simultaneously with motion correction; slice timing correction
    moved to be run after both
    <LI>Motion parameters can now be automatically added as confound
    EVs into the model
    <LI>New wizard for a few simple higher-level design setups
    <LI>Empty EVs are now allowed at first level (for consistent
    naming across multiple subjects)
  </UL>

<LI>FSLView v2.4 new features:
  <UL>
  <LI>Timeseries plotting of model vs. data for FEAT output
  <LI>FEAT cluster table interaction
  <LI>Various other smaller improvements, plus full compilable source code now distributed
  </UL>

<LI>Featquery changes:
  <UL>
    <LI> % signal change calculations are now fully automated for both
  complex contrasts and higher-level FEAT output
    <LI> Coordinate of max voxel also now reported in standard space mm
    <LI> Raw text file output added
</UL>

<LI>Glm: A new GUI (a stand-alone version of the FEAT design
matrix sub-GUI) for creating design matrix and contrast files, for
example for use in randomise.

<LI>SIENA v2.4 - the
siena and sienax scripts can now pass on all relevant options to BET
and FAST. Also the text output from sienax now includes unnormalised
volume reporting as well as the head-size-normalised volumes. (Note
also that small changes in FLIRT and FAST will mean that SIENA/SIENAX
results may be very slightly different from the previous version.)

<LI>FDR command-line program (fdr) is updated with a new definition of
valid-voxel mask generation.

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 3.2<font size=-1>&beta;</font>, September 2004</b>

<UL>

<LI>FDT (FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox) -
first release of this complete toolkit for analysis of diffusion
data, including probabilistic tractography.

<LI>FLOBS (FMRIB's Linear
Optimal Basis Functions) - a new method for finding an optimal set of
HRF convolution basis functions, plus a Bayesian estimation method
for improving signal/noise separation using these basis functions.

<LI>SMM (Spatial Mixture Modelling) -
a new tool for alternative hypothesis testing on statistic images
using histogram mixture modelling with spatial regularisation of the
voxel classification into activation and non-activation.

<LI>Randomise - a
randomisation-based inference tool for nonparametric statistical
thresholding.

<LI>BET v2 - can now estimate mesh
representations of the inner and outer skull surfaces, and outer
scalp surface, for example for use in EEG/MEG source modelling.

<LI>NIFTI - FSL now uses
the NIFTI-1 data format by default (though can still read and write
old Analyze files). Single-file NIFTI-1 images can be read and written
already compressed, saving much disk space.

<LI>FEAT v5.4 new features:
  <UL>
    <LI>Use of FLOBS (optimised HRF basis sets).
    <LI>Fixed-effects higher-level analysis (e.g. for within-subject
    cross-session analysis).
    <LI>Option to prevent cleanup of standard-space first-level stats.
    <LI>User preferences file (and network-wide preferences file)
    which can set FEAT preferences for loading on startup.
    <LI>Inclusion of MELODIC data exploration at the end of Pre-stats.
    <LI>Time-series (data vs model) plotting inside Featquery.
  </UL>

<LI>SIENA - can now do voxelwise cross-subject statistical atrophy
analysis. Also, there is a small change to the partial volume
estimation in FAST, causing slight differences in volume estimates;
any multi-subject analysis using FAST/SIENAX estimated volumes
must <i>only</i> use the previous version or <i>only</i> use this new
version.

<LI><b>fslerrorreport</b> is a new script which should always be run before
emailing the FSL email list with a problem concerning running programs
- the output from this will give us useful information about your
system.

</UL>


<hr><P><b>Release 3.1, July 2003</b><UL>

<LI>FLAME (Bayesian group stats modelling and estimation in FEAT5):
updated to give increased estimation accuracy at the MCMC stage, and
with added option for "FLAME stage 1 only" (nearly as fast as OLS and
nearly as accurate as full FLAME).

<LI>Beta-release of FSL for WindowsXP using Cygwin.

<LI>Beta-release of FSLView interactive 3D/4D viewer (currently compiled
for Linux/MacosX/Windows i.e. not yet IRIX/SunOS).

<LI>Various minor additions (such as progress viewer for FEAT) and bug-fixes.

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 3.0, October 2002</b><UL>

<!-- {{{ FEAT -->

<LI>FEAT v5: <UL>

<LI> Bayesian multi-subject FMRI analysis: General GLM for
higher-level analysis (e.g. analysis across sessions or across
subjects; paired t-tests, three-level groupings etc): FLAME (FMRIB's
Local Analysis of Mixed Effects). FLAME uses very sophisticated
methods for modelling and estimating the random-effects component of
the measured inter-session mixed-effects variance, using MCMC to get
an accurate estimation of the true random-effects variance and degrees
of freedom at each voxel.

<LI> Slice timing correction

<LI> Basis function HRF convolutions

<LI> Pre-threshold masking

<LI> Contrast masking after thresholding

<LI> Optionally registration can use two structural images as well as
standard space image.

<LI> Peristimulus timing plots in the web report.

<LI> Featquery - a program which allows you to interrogate FEAT results by
defining a mask or co-ordinates (in standard-space, highres-space
or lowres-space) and get mean stats values and time-series.

<LI> Although IRVA (semi-model-free analysis) is still bundled with
FSL, it is no longer an option within FEAT. This is because this kind
of analysis is effectively covered as a subset of the functionality of
FIR basis function analysis in FEAT.

</UL>

<!-- }}} -->
<!-- {{{ MELODIC -->

<LI>MELODIC v2: <UL>

<LI> Probabilistic ICA (PICA) for FMRI. By adding a Gaussian noise
model to the ICA model, and automatically estimating the
dimensionality (the number of non-Gaussian components), it is now
possible to create meaningful Z-statistic maps for each spatial
component, allowing inference ("thresholding").

<LI> Inference on the Z-statistic images is carried out with a
Gaussian/Gamma mixture model (fitted using EM), fitting central noise
and activation classes; thus alternative hypothesis testing is used.

</UL>

<!-- }}} -->

<LI>Interoperation with FreeSurfer - it is now very easy to display
FEAT results onto FreeSurfer-generated inflated or flattened surfaces,
and also easy to carry out group FEAT analysis in
standard-spherical-surface space instead of 3D standard space.

<LI>Interoperation with AFNI - AFNI can now easily read FSL
(particularly FEAT) output for easy visualisation.

<LI>SIENA v2: increased accuracy by forcing all steps to be symmetric;
added masking functionality including standard-space-based Z limits.

<LI>FLIRT&MCFLIRT; now run on single-slice (or few-slice) data; the
flirt -applyxfm option now allows the processing of 4D data; new GUIs
- ApplyXFM, ConcatXFM.

<LI>BET: new command-line options for surface initialisation; "bet"
now runs on binarised and on 2D images; the "betpremask" script uses
FLIRT registration to do standard-space masking instead of running
"bet"; bet now works on 4D images in two possible ways (the "betfunc"
script is suited to motion-corrected FMRI data, applying
over-inclusive masking, whilst just running "bet" on 4D data estimates
the brain mask from the first image and applies this to the rest);

</ul>

<hr><p><b>Releases 2.0 - e, internal development versions</b>

<hr><p><b>Release 1.3 for Mac OS X, November 2001</b>

<hr><P><b>Release 1.3, June 2001:</b><UL>

<LI>New: MELODIC - ICA-based model-free analysis of FMRI (and other 4D) data.

<LI>New: FAST - Brain segmentation (into different tissue types) and bias
field correction.

<LI>New: FUGUE - Unwarps geometric distortion in EPI images using
B<sub>0</sub> field maps.

<LI>New: SIENA - Structural brain change analysis, for estimating brain
atrophy.

<LI>FEAT 4.03: new features include F-tests and improved organisation
of GLM-setup GUI.

<LI>FLIRT: new features include image masking/weighting, different
output interpolations, and allowing 2D registration.

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 1.2a, May 2001 (not an FSL release but the version bundled
with MEDx 3.40):</b><UL>

<LI>FEAT 4.02: new features include F-tests and improved organisation
of GLM-setup GUI.

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 1.2, December 2000:</b><UL>

<LI>All GUIs can now run standalone - i.e., nothing in FSL needs
MEDx in order to run.

<LI>FSL now includes MCFLIRT motion correction, which is more
accurate, and faster, than the other tested MC methods. FEAT uses
MCFLIRT only.

<LI>FILM (the GLM method inside FEAT) now uses general
least-squares, prewhitening the data before the final fitting. This
gives more efficient activation estimation than the other methods
tested, particularly for dense single-event experiments. It includes
autocorrelation correction, using smoothing of autocorrelation
coefficients and nonlinear spatial filtering to achieve robust
estimation.

<LI>A new GUI "fsl" which calls the other main FSL tools.

<LI>The "model-free ANOVA" method has been renamed "IRVA"
(Inter-Repetition Variance Analysis) to avoid later confusion with ICA
truly model-free analysis (to be released shortly).

</UL>

<hr><P><b>Release 1.1, August 2000:</b><UL>

<LI>FEAT (FMRI analysis) will now use FLIRT (registration) to
automatically register your FMRI data to a high-resolution structural
and/or standard image for you, without having to use the FLIRT GUI
separately.

<LI>FEAT can now run group statistics (fixed-effects and random-effects)
across groups of FEAT directories, either in a single long FEAT run
(consisting of multiple first-level analyses followed by group-stats)
or on previously created FEAT directories.

<LI>You can now explicitly demand that certain EVs in FEAT be
orthogonalised with respect to other EVs in the design matrix.

<LI>FSL now works with both the latest MEDx release (3.30) and the
previous version (3.20).
