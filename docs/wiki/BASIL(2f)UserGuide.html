<h1 id="Kinetic_analysis_concepts">Kinetic analysis concepts</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-6"></span><p class="line874">BASIL permits various options to be applied when performing the kinetic model-based analysis, here some conceptual details of these options are given. Note that the way you choose these options varies between the different tools (see the individual guides for more information). <span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Definition_of_inversion_time">Definition of inversion time</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line874">Inversion time (commonly quoted for pASL) is defined as the time from the start of labelling to time of image acquisition. Often for cASL or pcASL the 'post labelling delay' is quoted and is the time from the end of the labelling until image acquisition. Thus: <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line874">cASL or pcASL: TI = PLD + Labelling duration <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line874">This distinction does not arise in pASL, since the labelling is instantaneous. <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Bolus_duration">Bolus duration</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><p class="line862">Although some ASL sequences fix the temporal duration of the bolus, e.g. QUIPSS2, due to dispersion it is still feasible that the actual bolus length may vary across the brain. BASIL can take this into account by inferring the bolus length directly from the data and <tt class="backtick">Oxford_asl</tt> does this by default. Even if you infer the bolus duration you should set a guess for the bolus duration as determined by you sequence. NOTE if your sequence results in an effectively infinite bolus length, e.g. FAIR, then there still might be a justification for inferring a finite bolus length depending upon the extent of the coil used for tagging. In which case you should set the bolus duration to some reasonable value (less than the last TI). <span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><p class="line874">For a cASL or pcASL acquisition the bolus duration will be set by the duration for which labeling was applied. Thus it is reasonable to fix the 'bolus duration' parameter to that value. <span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Macro_vascular_.28arterial.29_contribution">Macro vascular (arterial) contribution</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line862">If flow crushing has not been used then there may be significant signal from labeled arterial blood in the region of major vessels in the ASL data, for more information see Chappell et al., <em>MRM, 2010</em>. This is usually only an issue in short inversion time or post label delay images. For single delay ASL the issue is often avoided by chosing a suitably long delay such that label will have already passed into the capillary bed.For multi delay data the macro vaslcuar signal can be accounted for by modelling this arterial component (by default oxford_asl includes this component). When the macro vascular component is included in the analysis then a further parameter, the arterial blood volume, is available from the analysis. <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="T1_values">T1 values</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line874">T1 values are important to the kinetic model inversion and should be chosen based on the field strength that data was acquired at, consideration might also need to be taken of the subject in which analysis is being carried out. BASIL by deafult takes values for 3T and assumes for the tissue only a grey matter value, unless partial volume correction is applied when separate grey and white matter values are specified. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line874">Commonly it is assumed that T1 and T1b take a fixed value in the kinetic curve model. However, this value is not absolutely certain and may well vary across the brain. BASIL can take this into account by inferring on T1 and T1b, you should still, however, set sensible expected T1 and T1b values. NOTE: maps of T1 and T1b produced by this process are unlikely to be accurate measures of T1 in the brain - ASL data is not suitable for this. The purpose of including T1 and T1b in the inference is primarily to take account of their varaibility when estimating the other parameters. An exception to this is QUASAR data (in quasil) where a T1 image is estimated from the saturation recovery of the control data (and subsequently applied to the kinetic curve fitting). <span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Registration">Registration</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><p class="line862">Registration of ASL data to the structural image is difficult since the images are low resolution and with limited contrast. By default in <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> registration is carried out in multiple steps using the supplied ASL difference data, this is often sub optimal. A better result can be obtained by using the perfusion image directly to perform registration after the BASIL analysis. However, a far better option is generally to use the raw (undifferenced) ASL data as a basis for registration and the <tt class="backtick">--regfrom</tt> option in <tt class="backtick">oxford_asl</tt> exists for this purpose. The GUI will automatically try to use the raw data as the basis for registration for this reason. <span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Performing_fast_analysis">Performing fast analysis</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line874">By default BASIL does analysis in multiple steps adding new parameters a few at a time in separate analysis steps. It is possible to perform the analysis in a single step if you are using the basil command line tool, producing results more quickly. The result is likely to be less robust than the multi-step analysis when there are a large number of parameters in the model, i.e. if you are using all the inference options. It is, however, normally pretty stable in combination with spatial priors for most analysis problems. Thus you might want to use this to check the data, but use multiple steps for the very final result. <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Spatial_regularization">Spatial regularization</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line862">BASIL can apply a spatial smoothing prior to the estimated CBF image, for more information see Groves 'et al', <a class="nonexistent" href="./NeuroImage.html">NeuroImage</a>, 2009. This exploits the fact that neighboring voxels are likely to have similar CBF values, i.e. CBF variation in the brain is relatively smooth. It brings the advantages associated with the more common pre-processing step of spatially smoothing the data. However, unlike smoothing the data it correctly preserves the non-linear kinetics exploited by the CBF estimation. It is also adaptive, so that in regions where the data does not support the use of smoothing the CBF image will not be smoothed. The spatial priors can be combined with the fast analysis option to achieve rapid results with a good level of robustness to noise. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Partial_volume_correction">Partial volume correction</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><p class="line862">The low resolution of ASL data typically means that there is substantial partial voluming of grey (GM) and white matter (WM), plus CSF too. Since GM and WM have very different kinetics (WM tends to have lower CBF and longer arrival times) a normal analysis will provide a CBF that is something of a combination of the two tissue types. BASIL can attempt to automatically correct for the different tissue types, for more details see Chappell <em>et al.</em>, MRM, 2011. Currently oxford_asl can try to do this automatically as long as you supply a structural image, but this implementation is still in beta. <span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><p class="line862">A more fully tested implementation is available though the basil command line tool. For this you need to provide partial volume estimates (PVE) at the same resolution as the ASL data. PVE can be obtained from a structural image, for example using <tt class="backtick">FAST</tt>, the high resolution PVE image can then be converted using a transformation matrix from the structural to ASL image spaces, (obtained for example using <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> or <tt class="backtick">FLIRT</tt>). This step is best done using <tt class="backtick">applywarp</tt> to unsure that the values are the total PVE within the voxel, something like: <span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1-1"></span><div class="highlight console"><div class="codearea" dir="ltr" lang="en"><pre dir="ltr" id="CA-c77f41d5946277d8899ac8889f311fc5a1d34c7a" lang="en"><span class="line"><span class="anchor" id="line-1-2"></span><span class="LineNumber">applywarp --ref={asl_data} --in={PV_estimate_image} --out={PV_estimate_low_res} --premat={structural_to_ASL_tranformation_matrix} --super --interp=spline --superlevel=4</span></span>

<h1 id="Single_delay_data">Single delay data</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><p class="line874">BASIL was designed to make the most of the information available with multi delay data. With single delay measurements it is not possible to account for variation in bolus arrival time (BAT) and other parameters that are included in the kinetic model. However, if you assume a value for the BAT and other parameters then a CBF value can be determined using the kinetic model. BASIL will work with single delay data and will return the appropriate CBF image, the BAT value can be chosen for the analysis (the default is 0.7). BASIL may be advantageous for single TI data (over simply inverting the relevant model directly) when employing the spatial priors option (the fast option can be used at the same time) or when using partial volume correction. <span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><p class="line862">If you have a dataset containing just a single TI you will most probably have a whole series of volumes which are pairs of tag and control images where the measurement has been repeated a number of times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the final data. This can simply be fed into <tt class="backtick">Asl_gui</tt> to perform perfusion estimation. Otherwise to get a perfusion image you need to do tag-control subtraction and then take the average of these 'difference' images. This can be achieved neatly using asl_file: <span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><p class="line867"><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-1-3"></span><div class="highlight console"><div class="codearea" dir="ltr" lang="en"><pre dir="ltr" id="CA-6d01ddbe57bbf0110896d04efff2d07a7ce1b312" lang="en"><span class="line"><span class="anchor" id="line-1-4"></span><span class="LineNumber">asl_file --data={raw_data} --ntis=1 --iaf=tc --diff --mean={output_name}</span></span>
<span class="line"><span class="anchor" id="line-2-2"></span><span class="LineNumber"></span></span>
</pre></div></div><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><p class="line874">This will provide an image of (relative) perfusion in the same units as the original data. If you want absolute perfusion you will need both an estimate of the M0 of blood and to apply an inverted version of the kinetic model. The latter can be achieved using oxford_asl or BASIL, the former may be possible from the raw data (assuming you do not have background suppressed data) or a separate calibration image using oxford_asl or asl_calib. <span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span>
<h1 id="Asl_gui">Asl_gui</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><p class="line874">The graphical user interface to the BASIL tools can be accessed by typing either Asl (linux) or Asl_gui (OS X) at the command line. It should provide most of the options required for analysis of ASL data inlcuding the majority of the more advanced features of BASIL. <span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><p class="line867"><strong>Note</strong>: Asl_gui was only officially released with FSL 5.0.3 (any previous versions are unlikely to be very stable and will not adhere to the documentation here). This is still a beta version, we expect to add further features and refine the interface for a future release. <span class="anchor" id="line-60"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-61"></span><p class="line867"><strong>Note</strong>: Changes in oxford_asl in FSL 5.0.6 also apply to asl_gui - namely that inversion efficiency is now included in the calculation (using default values) and that structural images shoud have been brain extracted before input to asl_gui. <span class="anchor" id="line-62"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><p class="line874">Asl_gui has four tabs, whose function are failry obvious: <span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-65"></span><ul><li>Data: Specify details of the ASL data here, as well as any supplementary data such as a structural image. <span class="anchor" id="line-66"></span></li><li>Analysis: Options relating to the analysis, primarily the kinetic model and the estimation process. <span class="anchor" id="line-67"></span></li><li>Registration: Options relating to the registration of the results to the structural image. <span class="anchor" id="line-68"></span></li><li>Calibration: Options relating to the estimation of M0a (the equilibrium magnetization of arterial blood) for absolute quantification of pefusion. <span class="anchor" id="line-69"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-70"></span></li></ul><p class="line874">More details on each tab are provided below.

This is done in the parameter file using the <tt class="backtick">--noise-pattern=</tt> option, which is used as follows: Taking the example of data with 4 TIs each repeated 5 times, to get a different noise magnitude at each inversion time use: <tt class="backtick">--noise-pattern=11111222223333344444</tt> i.e. the first 5 entries correspond to the first TI and these should use the first noise magnitude, the next 5 entries are the next TI and next noise magnitude etc. NOTE: if you have more than 9 TIs then for the 10th TI and onward letters should be used in place of numbers starting with a, i.e. for 12 TIs and 2 repeats: <tt class="backtick">--noise-pattern=112233445566778899aabbcc</tt> NOTE: if you have only a small number of repeats (like these examples) then this more complex noise modelling is probably not a good idea. <span class="anchor" id="line-285"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-286"></span><p class="line867"><hr /><p class="line874"> <span class="anchor" id="line-287"></span>

<span class="anchor" id="line-372"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> will let you choose what 'tissue' you want to use as the reference. M0 is calculated within a mask of this 'tissue', as the mean over all the voxels within the mask. This option tells <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> which 'tissue' from the automatic segmentation as well as what T1 and T2(*) values should be used. <span class="anchor" id="line-373"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-374"></span><p class="line862">By default <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> uses CSF as the reference because it is relatively easy to segment and a mask can be defined containing a reasonable number of voxels that do not suffer substantial partial volume effects. The automated masking is optimized to extract CSF from the ventricles and thus is probably the best reference to use. White matter is a reasonable alternative as partial volume effects can be minimized to a good degree. Grey matter is generally not a good option for that reason. <span class="anchor" id="line-375"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-376"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-377"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> attempts to automatically generate the reference 'tissue' mask from the structural image, unless you supply your own custom mask with the <tt class="backtick">-m</tt> option. It does this using <tt class="backtick">FAST</tt>, thus the normal caveats for segmentation when using that program apply, for example the structural image must already have been brain extracted. <span class="anchor" id="line-378"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-379"></span><p class="line862">Having a really perfect mask is not vital, since the calibration is performed over all the voxels within the mask. However, the mask needs to at least be sensible, hence it is a very good idea to check the mask created at the end to see if it is sensible. If <tt class="backtick">asl_calib</tt> detects that after segmentation, transformation into ASL native space and thresholding, that there are no voxels in the mask it will halt and tell you that the automated method has failed. <span class="anchor" id="line-380"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-381"></span><p class="line867">
