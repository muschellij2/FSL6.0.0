<h2 id="Deformation_model">Deformation model</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-7"></span><p class="line874">An affine transformation is characterised by a coordinate transform defined as <span class="anchor" id="line-8"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-9"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/linear_transformation.png" title="basis functions" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-10"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-11"></span><p class="line862">where <strong>A</strong> is a 4x4 matrix that is uniquely defined by 12 values (3 translations, 3 rotations, 3 zooms and 3 shears). This is sufficient to model overall differences in position and size between different brains. However it is often not sufficient for modelling more &quot;local&quot; differences such as <em>e.g.</em> enlarged ventricles or sulci. One may then instead use a non-linear transformation given by <span class="anchor" id="line-12"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-13"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/non_linear_transformation.png" title="basis functions" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-14"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-15"></span><p class="line862">The crucial part here are the <em>di(x,y,z)</em>, the warp fields. These are three (one for each dimension) fields of displacements, each of which have the same size as the image one is warping towards. They are often represented as linear combinations of basis-functions, thereby reducing the number of parameters that needs to be determined. In the case of fnirt they are represented by quadratic or cubic B-splines. <span class="anchor" id="line-16"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-17"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Cost-function">Cost-function</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-18"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-19"></span><p class="line874">The only cost-function presently implemented in fnirt is the &quot;sum-of-squared differences&quot;. I.e. it attempts to minimize the function <span class="anchor" id="line-20"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-21"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/simple_cost_function.png" title="basis functions" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-22"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-23"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-24"></span><p class="line862">where f denotes the &quot;reference image&quot; (e.g. the MNI152-template) and g denotes the image we want to warp. This would potentially limit its (fnirt's) use to cases where the images f and g are very similar, as opposed to other cost-functions like e.g. correlation-ratio or mutual information which are less sensitive to differences in contrast. However, the sum-of-squared differences cost-function has important advantages when <a href="./FNIRT(2f)UserGuide.html#Optimisation">searching</a> for the parameters that minimize its value. In addition fnirt has the option of <a href="./FNIRT(2f)UserGuide.html#Intensity_modulation">modulating the intensity</a> of f, both globally and locally, that addresses the issue of differences in contrast. <span class="anchor" id="line-25"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Optimisation">Optimisation</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line862">Registration (linear or non-linear) is really a non-linear optimisation problem in that there is some function O that depends in a non-linear fashion on some set of parameters <strong>w</strong>, and we want to find the values of <strong>w</strong> that minimizes O. Methods for finding the parameters <strong>w</strong> come in various flavors; Some will require only the ability to calculate O(<strong>w</strong>) whereas other relies also on the first, and possibly second, derivatives with respect to <strong>w</strong>. Methods in the latter category can potentially have large advantages over the former in terms of executions speed, something that is especially important when there are a large number of unknown parameters. <span class="anchor" id="line-29"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-30"></span><p class="line862">The Gauss-Newton method falls into the second category and is an approximation to the Newton-Raphson method that is valid when the function O is a sum-of-squares. It provides an explicit formula for where to take the next step in the parameter space <strong>w</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-31"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-32"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/gauss_newton_step.png" title="basis functions" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-33"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-34"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-35"></span><p class="line862">Where <strong>H</strong> and âˆ‡O denotes the Hessian and the gradient of O respectively. This is an advantage of Gauss-Newton over many other methods that will only provide a direction in which to search for a local minima, and will potentially enable faster convergence. <span class="anchor" id="line-36"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-37"></span><p class="line862">Fnirt has been implemented using a Levenberg-Marquardt modification of the Gauss-Newton method and great effort has gone into an efficient calculation of <strong>H</strong>. <span class="anchor" id="line-38"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-39"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Sub-sampling">Sub-sampling</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-40"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-41"></span><p class="line862">One of the difficulties in non-linear registration is to avoid logal minima. To understand this think of a section of cortex with two sulci from two different subjects. Let us furthermore assume that due to different shape brains the two sulci are shifted along the surface of the cortex in one brain relative to the other. A reasonable &quot;solution&quot; to this problem would be to translate the two sulci until they match up. Another solution would be to simply flatten out the existing sulci, and create two new ones in the correct position. Because of the considerable freedom in the transformations with a non-linear registrations this is something that could actually happen. One way of forcing the warps towards being more &quot;reasonable&quot; in that sense is through <a href="./FNIRT(2f)UserGuide.html#Regularisation">regularisation</a>. Another is &quot;sub-sampling&quot; or &quot;multi-resolution&quot; registration. That means that one starts out by sub-sampling, i.e. degrading the resolution of the images, by some factor and then register the resulting low-resolution images together. This ensures that gross structures in the images are registered first. The warp-fields from this first registration are now used as intial values in a second registration, this time with less sub-sampling and so forth until finally one is using the full resolution of the images (i.e. no sub-sampling at all). <span class="anchor" id="line-42"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-43"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Regularisation">Regularisation</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-44"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-45"></span><p class="line874">All non-linear registration is a compromise between minimising the cost-function, i.e. between making the images look as similar as possible, and making the warps/displacements &quot;reasonable&quot;. This is based on a notion that some warps are more reasonable, or probable, than others. We typicall find a smoother warp more likely than one that is very sharp. In addition there is the notion of one-to-one and onto. With one-to-one we mean that there can only be one point in the original space mapping into any given point in the transformed space and by onto we mean that there cannot be any points in the transformed space to which there is no mapping. <span class="anchor" id="line-46"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-47"></span><p class="line874">This compromise is formalised by some regularising function, typically with concepts borrowed from mechanics. Examples of regularising functions are &quot;membrane energy&quot; and &quot;bending energy&quot;. These are functions of the warps themselves, the images doesn't enter into it, that have a high value for sharp warps and a small value for smooth warps. <span class="anchor" id="line-48"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-49"></span><p class="line874">Hence the cost-function that we really minimise is <span class="anchor" id="line-50"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-51"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="basis functions" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/cost_function_with_regularisation.png" title="basis functions" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-52"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-53"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-54"></span><p class="line874">where Îµ is the regularisation function and Î» is a &quot;fudge factor&quot; that determines the relative balance between how &quot;similar&quot; the images get and how &quot;smooth&quot; we want the warps. <span class="anchor" id="line-55"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-56"></span><p class="line874">Below is an example of warping a subject (with some atrophy) to the MNI152 template with &quot;medium&quot; regularisation (Î»=30 with the ssqlambda option set) and with &quot;little&quot; regularisation (Î»=8 with the ssqlambda option set) <span class="anchor" id="line-57"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-58"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-59"></span><div><table><tbody><tr>  <td><p class="line891"><img alt="flirted_subj2.jpg" class="attachment" height="150" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/flirted_subj2.jpg" title="flirted_subj2.jpg" /></td>

With the smaller value for Î» (warp and image on the right) the image is slightly more similar to the template, in particular the ventricles and the left Sylvian fissure, but at the expense of sharper warps. For this particular data set there are more than ten voxels (in the whole volume) where the one-to-one condition has been violated when using the lower value for Î», so clearly the larger value is more appropriate in this case. <span class="anchor" id="line-63"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-64"></span><p class="line862">We refer to Î» as a &quot;fudge factor&quot;, and the reason for that is that we have no principled way of deriving an appropriate value for it.

If one for example wants to register structural T1-weighted images with reasonable contrast and signal-to-noise one determines, once and for all, a suitable value for Î» and uses that for subsequent studies.

<h2 id="Is_it_diffeomorphic_.28and_what_does_.22diffeomorphic.22_mean.29.3F">Is it diffeomorphic (and what does &quot;diffeomorphic&quot; mean)?</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-88"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-89"></span><p class="line862">A diffeomorphic mapping from a space <em>U</em> to a space <em>V</em> is one which has exactly one position in <em>V</em> for each position in <em>U</em>, which also means that it is invertible and that the Jacobian of the mapping is greater than zero at each location. This is clearly a desirable property, and one which people try to achieve in non-linear registration. In recent years it has become popular to use algorithms where diffeomorphism is guaranteed by construction. To understand this we need to look at how the warps are constructed from a series of iterations. In our (oldfashioned) case the displacement field is constructed as the sum of the updates calculated at each iteration. <span class="anchor" id="line-90"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-91"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="sum of displacements" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/sum_of_displacements.png" title="sum of displacements" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-92"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-93"></span><p class="line874">This means that even if each and every update is diffeomorphic in itself, the sum may not neccessarily be. There are algorithms that will instead construct the displacement field from the updates as <span class="anchor" id="line-94"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-95"></span><p class="line867"><img align="top" alt="combination of displacments" class="attachment" src="attachments/FNIRT(2f)UserGuide/combination_of_displacements.png" title="combination of displacments" /> <span class="anchor" id="line-96"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-97"></span><p class="line867"><em>i.e.</em> they are warping the warps rather than adding them. In this latter case one can guarantee that <strong>d</strong> is diffeomorphic as long as each of the <strong>d</strong><sub>i</sub> are diffeomorphic. This means that one can use heavy regularisation (big Î») when calculating each update, thereby ensuring diffeomorphism for each step, and then perform many updates (iterations) thereby still accomodating large displacements. <span class="anchor" id="line-98"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-99"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> is <strong>not</strong> diffeomorphic by construction, <em>i.e.</em> it sums the updates. Hence after each update (iteration) there is a risk that the field is no longer diffeomorphic. Therefore <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> uses a different &quot;trick&quot; which means that after each sub-sampling level it checks for non-diffeomorphic fields (by searching for &lt;=0 Jacobians) and if it finds any it will project the field onto the closest diffeomorphic field. <span class="anchor" id="line-100"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-101"></span><p class="line862">This is, perhaps, less elegant then ensuring diffeomorphism by construction, but also has its own advantages. A method that guarantees dieffeomorphism by construction guarantees <strong>only</strong> that. The Jacobians can in principle become infinitely close to zero which can, depending on the reason for the registration, be a problem. In contrast fnirt has the ability to project the warp onto any manifold consisting of mappings with Jacobians within a specified range. By for example setting <tt class="backtick"></tt>--jacrange=0.2,5<tt class="backtick"></tt> one specifies that one wants to find the &quot;best&quot; warps of all those for which there are no local contractions/expansions of volume greater than 5. <span class="anchor" id="line-102"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-103"></span><p class="line867">

Fnirt has a large set of parameters that determine what is done, and how it is done. Without a knowledge of these parameters you will not get the best results that you can. These parameters are described below, but it should be said that there are many of them, and to complicate things further they are linked such that the value of one parameter will determine what is the optimal value to use for another parameter. Hence, the command line options for fnirt offers a lot of flexibility but are difficult to use unless one is an expert on non-linear registration. We therefore offer the option of using configuration files that hides the complexity of fnirt and we strongly encourage using these rather than specifying command line options oneself. <span class="anchor" id="line-110"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-111"></span><p class="line867">

<span class="anchor" id="line-112"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-113"></span><p class="line862">A configuration file is a text file containing some or all of the parameters that can be specified for <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt>. The name of the file should be passed as argument to the <tt class="backtick">--config</tt> parameter. It should be an ascii-file with one row for each parameter, and where comments (ignored by <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt>) are preceeded by a #. A very simple (and silly) config file named <tt class="backtick">my_silly_file.cnf</tt> could look like <span class="anchor" id="line-114"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-115"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">#&nbsp;I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;membrane&nbsp;energy&nbsp;for&nbsp;regularisation</tt><br>

These contain parameters that have been found to be useful for registering a good quality T1-weighted 3D acquisition to the MNI152 template and for registering a good quality FA image to the FMRIB58 template. Together with the override facility this is probably the starting (an quite possible finishing) point for most users. Let us say for example that you want to register a T1 scan to the MNI152 template, but that you want to push warp-resolution a little beyond that given in <tt class="backtick">T1_2_MNI152_2mm.cnf</tt> (10mm isotropic).

Meanwhile if you have an application for which neither of the predefined config files is appropriate you may want to read about the individual parameters below and write your own file. We would then recommend to start with one of the predefined files (that which seems more appropriate given your application) and gradually change it to suit your application. Alternatively if your application is of sufficient general interest you may contact us and we can together devise a file for that application. <span class="anchor" id="line-133"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-134"></span><p class="line867">
<h2 id="Running_.60fnirt.60_efficiently">Running `fnirt` efficiently</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-135"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-136"></span><p class="line862">This paragraph contains some general advice that is useful to ensure that <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> is run in an &quot;optimal&quot; manner. <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> is designed to be a &quot;medium resolution&quot; non-linear registration method. Hence it is intended to be used with a warp-resolution of ~10mm. If/when attempting to go much below that (i.e. below ~5mm) one starts to pay a high price both in terms of working memory and execution time. In general this is not a big problem since a 10mm warp-resolution is typically sufficient to register two brains. <span class="anchor" id="line-137"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-138"></span><p class="line862">Another factor that greatly affects execution time and memory requirements is the resolution and the field-of-view (FOV) of the <tt class="backtick">--ref</tt> image respectively. Let us say one wants for example to register one T1-scan to another. Tpical scan parameters may then be <em>e.g.</em> a 208x256x192 matrix-size with a 1x1x1mm resolution. With that FOV (208x256x192mm) there are typically thick slabs of non-brain in all directions and it may be cropped extensively (using the <tt class="backtick">fslroi</tt> command) without loss of any brain. If one is <em>e.g.</em> able to crop it down to a 146x194x130 matrix (numbers taken from a specific example) one will have reduced both execution time and memory requirements by 60%. <span class="anchor" id="line-139"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-140"></span><p class="line862">If one additionaly specifies a subsampling of 2 at the lowest level (e.g. <tt class="backtick">--subsamp=8,4,2,2</tt>) there is a further reduction of execution time by a factor of eight. This implies that the full resolution of the images is never used for estimation of the warps, but that makes very little difference when using a warp-resolution of 10mm. When/if using subsampling of 2 the subsampled voxels have a size of 2x2x2mm which means that each spline-function has a support of 5832 voxels which is typically more than sufficient. If one uses the full resolution the support is a staggering 54872 voxels which is unneccessarily large and &quot;wastes&quot; execution time. <span class="anchor" id="line-141"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-142"></span><p class="line862">It should also be realized that the level of subsampling that is used when estimating the warps does not affect the resolution of the final warp-field. It will still produce a field with the full resolution of the <tt class="backtick">--ref</tt> volume and the registered volume will have the full resolution of the <tt class="backtick">--ref</tt> volume. An example of a config file that uses this &quot;trick&quot; is <tt class="backtick">FA_2_FMRIB58_1mm.cnf</tt>, which is used to register an FA-volume to the FMRIB 1mm (overkill) FA template. <span class="anchor" id="line-143"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-144"></span><p class="line862">Other parameters that has an effect on efficiency include <tt class="backtick">--splineorder</tt> and <tt class="backtick">--numprec</tt>. <span class="anchor" id="line-145"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-146"></span><p class="line867">
<h1 id="Understanding_sub-sampling_levels">Understanding sub-sampling levels</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="line-147"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-148"></span><p class="line862">It is important to understand the concept of different sub-sampling levels and how that affects how one can/need to specify the different paramaters of <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt>. As described <a href="./FNIRT(2f)UserGuide.html#Sub-sampling">above</a> in the theory section an execution of fnirt is really several consecutive registrations with increasing use of high frequency information. An example of a subsampling scheme might be --subsamp=4,2,1,1 which specifies that four consecutive registrations should be performed, the first with the --ref volume sub-sampled by a factor 4, the second by a factor 2 and the two final registrations at full resolution. Given this there are some parameters that it makes sense to define &quot;once and for all&quot; and use for all four registration. An example of such a parameter is <tt class="backtick">--regmod</tt> which specifies what regularisation model to use (&quot;membrane energy&quot; or &quot;bending energy&quot;). <span class="anchor" id="line-149"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-150"></span><p class="line862">For other parameters it makes more sense to specify a separate value for each sub-sampling level. An example of such a parameter is <tt class="backtick">--lambda</tt> which could for subsampling scheme above be set to e.g. <tt class="backtick">--lambda=200,75,40,20</tt>. What this means is that we are using a larger relative weighting of the regularisation term, <em>i.e</em>. we are forcing the warps to be smoother, for the registrations performed at lower resolution (larger sub-sampling). Note also how, in this example, at the final resolution we perform two registrations with decreasing regularisation. <span class="anchor" id="line-151"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-152"></span><p class="line862">Hence the parameters for <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> are divided into those that are defined &quot;once and for all&quot; and those that can/should be defined once for each sub-sampling level. That means that there must be a complete correspondence between the parameters in the latter category. It is for example correct to specify <span class="anchor" id="line-153"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-154"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">fnirt&nbsp;...&nbsp;--subsamp=4,2,1,1&nbsp;--lambda=200,75,40,20&nbsp;...</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-155"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-156"></span><p class="line862">but <strong>not</strong> correct to specify <span class="anchor" id="line-157"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-158"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">fnirt&nbsp;...&nbsp;--subsamp=4,2,1&nbsp;--lambda=200,75,40,20&nbsp;...</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-159"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-160"></span><p class="line874">The exception to this is that it is correct to specify a single value for parameters that can/should be defined once for each level of sub-sampling.

On the other hand we would like to focus our effort on the brain and are quite happy to ignore scalp and other extra cranial tissue. Including extra cranial tissue in the estimation may cause problems for 2 reasons. With a limited resolution of the warps we want to focus on aligning brain structures. Aligning for example the scalp may have a detrimental effect on the alignment of the cortex nearby. Secondly, the intensity in scalp and other extra cranial tissue tend to vary wildly between sequences, much more so than brain tissue.

<span class="anchor" id="line-295"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-296"></span><p class="line862">Fnirt is rather primitive in its view of the brain. It considers it as a set of intensity values and has no model for different structures, tissue types etc. It would just as happily register a photo of your face to one of your house as two brains together. It is therefore unable to handle cases where a structure (<em>e.g.</em> a tumor or a stroke) is present in one of the images and not the other. However, it may still be of interest to register such a brain into a standard space in order to study effects on structures at some distance from the pathology. Note that this case is distinct from pathologies where existing structures changes its size and/or shape, a case that fnirt can often handle quite well (see <a href="./FNIRT.html">introduction</a>). <span class="anchor" id="line-297"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-298"></span><p class="line862">It can therefore be useful to supply a mask in the space of the <tt class="backtick">--in</tt> image. The mask must be binary and is inclusive (i.e. any voxel with a zero value gets excluded). The <tt class="backtick">--inmask</tt> is warped along with the <tt class="backtick">--in</tt> image in accordance with the current field. This means that the mask can/will cchange its size and shape as the <tt class="backtick">--in</tt> image is being warped. Voxels falling outside the mask will be excluded when estimating the warps. <span class="anchor" id="line-299"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-300"></span><p class="line862">An example may make it concrete. Let us say we have a tumor that has an intensity that deviates from the surrounding tissue, and let us say we did not mask it out. Fnirt would then shrink the tumor (and therefore the area with deviation intensities) as much as it can, meanwhile expanding surrounding tissues to &quot;fill the <tt class="backtick">--ref</tt> brain out&quot;. If on the other hand we mask it out the intensity values within the tumor will be ignored and the tumor will be warped in accordance with the surrounding (non-masked) structures. <span class="anchor" id="line-301"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-302"></span><p class="line862">So, let us say you have a an image called <tt class="backtick">some_brain_with_tumor.nii</tt> that you want to register to the MNI152 template.

It is rather related to how fast the displacements can change as on goes from one point to the next in the displacement field. An example of a situation where high resolution is useful is when registering an atrophied brain (with enlarged ventricles and an atrophied Putamen) to a &quot;normal&quot; template.

A spline of lower order (2 in this case) has a smaller support, <em>i.e</em>. it &quot;covers&quot; fewer voxels, for a given knot-spacing/warp-resolution.

Modelling the intensity involves estimation of another set of parameters (in addition to those modelling the warps) and will hence increase both execution time and memory requirements. There are six different intensity models. These differ in the kind of differences they can model and also in the number of additional parameters that fnirt has to estimate. The models are <span class="anchor" id="line-397"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-398"></span><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">--intmod=none</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-399"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This is in fact no intensity model at all. It simply assumes that the images are identical apart from differences in shape. This is the model one &quot;usually&quot; means when talking about a &quot;sum-of-squared differences cost-function&quot;. It is useful mainly for quantitative images such as e.g. FA-images. <span class="anchor" id="line-400"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-401"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">--intmod=global_linear</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-402"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This is the simplest of the actual intensity models. It assumes a linear relationship between the intensities in the two image. It needs to estimate one additional parameter, the slope of the linear relationship. It correponds (roughly) to a traditional correlation-coefficient cost-function. It is useful mainly for registering images acquired with the same scanner and sequence when the images has no or very little intensity inhomogeneity. <span class="anchor" id="line-403"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-404"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">--intmod=global_non_linear</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-405"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">This model assumes that there is some curved relationship between the intensities in the two images. Imagine creating a scatter-plot where for each point takes its x-value from a voxel in the --ref image and the y-value from the same voxel in the (warped) --in image. Let us further assume that this scatter-plot displays a pattern where the majority of the points fall along a curved path. Using this model fnirt will fit a polynomial-function to that curve. The order of the polynomial will be determined by the value of the parameter --intorder (and this is also the number of additional parameters that needs to be estimated). It assumes that the curved intensity relationship is the same for all parts of the image (global). It corresponds (roughly) to a correlation-ratio cost-function. It is useful when both images (--ref and --in) have little or no intensity inhomogeneity and they have been acquired with similar sequences but on different scanners or with slightly different sequences on the same scanner. It could e.g. be used to register two T1-weighted images where the degree of weighting was a little different but would not work for registering a T1- to a T2-weighted image. <span class="anchor" id="line-406"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-407"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">--intmod=local_linear</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-408"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none"><p class="line862">Frequently MR images exhibit RF intensity inhomogeneity, i.e. there is a smoothly varying multiplicative bias-field.

The number of additional parameters are given by <tt class="backtick">--intorder</tt> and <tt class="backtick">--biasres</tt> and is the sum of the numbers for the two previous models. This means that execution time is roughly twice that of e.g. a global_linear model. It is useful when the images are acquired with different scanners and/or slightly different sequences and one or both images have discernible intensity inhomogeneities. This is a suitable model for many cases. One frequently wishes to register an individual image to a template representing some standard space. The subject/subjects constituting the template have typically been scanned elsewhere, and will therefore not have identical contrast. In addition it is very likely that the images will both (or at least ones own) be affected by bias-fields. This is e.g. the model that is used in the T1_2_MNI152_2mm.cnf configuration file. <span class="anchor" id="line-412"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-413"></span></li></ul><p class="line867"><tt class="backtick">--intmod=local_non_linear</tt> <span class="anchor" id="line-414"></span><ul><li style="list-style-type:none">The local_linear and global_non_linear_with_bias both estimate a single multiplicative bias-field.

These values are used as the coefficients for a local polynomial that models the intensities. This means that, unlike e.g. with a global_non_linear_with_bias model, it can model regionally varying contrast. This, we think, can be useful for high-field scanning where spatially varying flip-angles become a significant problem.

<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<span class="anchor" id="line-568"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-569"></span><p class="line862">These are a set of command line utilities for handling, applying and transforming warp-fields created with fnirt, or any other application that produces warp-fields with a compatible format. Using these tools you can take the coefficient-field (the output for the <a href="./FNIRT.html#A--cout">--cout argument of fnirt</a>) and create any other <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> output. Hence, it is often a good idea to just specify the <tt class="backtick">--cout</tt> for <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt>, thereby saving space, and then create the oter files of/when they are needed. <span class="anchor" id="line-570"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-571"></span><p class="line862">The output of the <tt class="backtick">--cout</tt> parameter of <tt class="backtick">fnirt</tt> is a 4D-file with three (for the x-, y- and z-directions) volumes of coefficients for quadratic/cubic splines. To go from a volume of coefficients to a displacement field each of the coefficients are multiplied with a 3D spline with a unique location within the displacement volume. Hence, the field is uniquely defined given the information in the coefficient-file. All (I think) the FSL applications that uses warp-fields have been written so that they accept either a coefficient-file or a field-file, which means that the average user does not really need to know exactly what format his/her warps are in. <span class="anchor" id="line-572"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-573"></span><p class="line867">

Let us further say that you have (don't ask me how) an affine transform (<tt class="backtick">MNI_2_Tal.mat</tt>) that maps the MNI space to something that is a better approximation of the Talairach space.

The default interpolation method is tri-linear, which is mostly sufficient and what we want to do. There are times though when it is better to use &quot;nearest neighbour&quot; interpolation, which means &quot;set the intensity in the output voxel to the same value as the closest (after the mapping) voxel in the input volume&quot;. An advantage of nearest-neighbour interpolation is that it does't create any &quot;new&quot; intensity values. Let us say <em>e.g</em>. that we have a file of ROI's, where each ROI is characterized by a given intensity value. If we e.g. have three ROI's the voxels in the ROI-volume would take the values 0, 1, 2 or 3.

To reduce execution time it may e.g. be a good idea to crop <tt class="backtick">my_struct</tt> (before any of the processing steps) so that the FOV is reasonably &quot;tight&quot;. If you look at the MNI templates you can get an idea of what a suitable &quot;tightness&quot; is. <span class="anchor" id="line-715"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-716"></span><p class="line867">
