The probabilities stored in these maps are calculated for each cortical zone and each striatal voxel, with one map/image of the striatum provided for each zone.  These probabilities are defined as the number of subjects with a within-subject-connection-probability (between the striatal voxel and the cortical target) higher than 50%, divided by the total number of subjects. There is also a version provided that uses a threshold of 25% (striatum-con-prob-thr25). The within-subject-connection-probabilities are calculated using <a class="http" href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/connect/references.html">probabilistic diffusion tractography</a>, where a connection probability in each voxel, to each cortical target, is estimated as described by Johansen-Berg et al. (2005). In brief, the within-subject-connection-probability from a voxel to a particular cortical zone is defined as the total number of samples from that voxel that reach the particular cortical area divided by the total number of samples from that voxel that reached any cortical area.

In total 26 healthy human volunteers were scanned and to achieve the connectivity-base subdivision in each subject, a two-step procedure was applied (figure 3): Phase I:  the projections from the four brain lobes (frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal) to the striatum were calculated and the striatal areas associated with each lobe were established; Phase II: The frontal lobe was subdivided into four anatomical ROIs, each associated with a particular functional specialization (limbic, executive, rostral motor and caudal motor), and projections between these anatomical ROIs and the striatal area associated with the frontal lobe was estimated.  <span class="anchor" id="line-26"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-27"></span><span class="anchor" id="line-28"></span><p class="line867"><img align="middle" alt="Figure 3.
